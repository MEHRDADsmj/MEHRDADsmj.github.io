                HeroStrike was my first serious mobile game that was launched on the GooglePlay store. I made this game with my colleagues at FreeStateGames and it helped 
                me learn lots of things about Unity and performance optimization on android devices.

              <p>
                We started the project based on a concept from the game "Monster Strike". It is a slingshot-based game with enemies and some boss fights. Our designer 
                said we could start "hyper-casualizing" it and so we did!<br>
                The first new challenge was to draw waypoints for the player to figure out where his pawn will
                slide to. I learned about nested scenes and simulating physics in a separate scene to predict the path of the player's pawn. I also implemented a basic
                looping system to iterate through players and make it a turn-based game, just like the original game.<br>
                The second challenge was to optimize the game's performance for android devices. The physics needed to be precise and at the same time, we were having lags on 
                some devices. After a ton of tweaking, we found the sweet spot for the physics timestep. I also managed to work with quality settings to reduce the 
                rendering overhead for mobiles. This included making changes to textures, materials, particle systems, lighting, scaling, scripts, and again, physics.
                <br>
                The third challenge was simply this: We had never launched an app on GooglePlay by ourselves before!<br>
                So I started digging everything out and carefully took every step one by one. At first, I was anxious to take any action, but finally, I took all the 
                steps correctly and the game was launched in the store!<br>
                Despite no previous experience, lack of resources, high CPI on the final tests, and certain events in my country of residence, as Bruce Banner said in
                the movie, "I see this as an absolute win!". I learned a lot about the market, how it works, and how to successfully launch a game on GooglePlay.
                This was an invaluable experience, both in marketing and technical aspects.
